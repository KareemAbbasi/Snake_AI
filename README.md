# Snake AI 
A project that uses AI to play the Snake game. This was done as a project for the Introduction to AI course at HUJI.


In this project we used a number of different methods to solve the Snake game. These methods include:
1. A* pathfinding algorithm using a number of different heuristic functions.
2. Reinforcement learning using the Q-learning algorithm.


In order to make the game harder, we experienced with different thing to the game board such as obstacles.

### Results
The results achieved from all the different methods can be found in our report ```SnakeAiAgentReport.pdf``` 


## How to use
The code can be found in the ```Snake_AI_code``` directory.

### To run the code
1. Run the command ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run ```python3 game.py``` to start the game.

You can use ```python3 game.py``` to show all options.
